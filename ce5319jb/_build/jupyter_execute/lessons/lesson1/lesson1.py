# # Introduction

# ## Why study machine learning?
# 
# The availability of big data is transforming Civil Engineering profession. Data-driven tools and
# algorithms have the promise to model nonlinear civil engineering phenomena and extract
# information that is not possible through traditional modeling methods. Machine learning is a fast-
# growing field and its use in civil engineering will likely become routine in the next few years. The
# primary objective of this course is to provide a theoretical introduction and exposure to ML
# applications in Civil Engineering.

# ## Computational Environment
# 
# The course itself is mathematically oriented and will require developing scripts (computer programs).  The default computational environment is a Jupyter Notebook running an iPython kernel.
# 
# :::{note}
# In fact this on-line document is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks rendered using a program called Sphinx that converts the notebooks into a website (which you are now accessing).  For me the author its cool because I just make notebooks and bind them at my leisure (there are some nuances to get figures into the books and embedding code - but its not too hard to do so.  Jupyter as a literate programming environment is quite useful even outside of the University.

# ### Why Python?
# A skilled user can install an R kernel into Jupyter and run R scripts.  I tend to use python because I also teach undergraduate programming in python and don't want to confuse myself.  I am literate in R, but prefer python slightly.  So we will default to python unless something is way easier in R (and will probably still do a mixed language call in that instance!).
# 
# 
# No prior experience with Python or R are required, but familiarity with programming concepts covered in ENGR 1330: Computational Thinking with Data Science and in CE 5315: Probabilistic Methods for Engineers is expected. Students are strongly encouraged to take CE 5310 Numerical Methods in Engineering prior to this
# course.
