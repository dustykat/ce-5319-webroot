    "Nonlinear regression is a form of regression analysis in which observational data are modeled by a function which is a **nonlinear** combination of the model parameters and depends on one or more independent (predictor, explainatory, feature ...) variables. The data are fitted by a method of successive approximations. \n"

    "Other examples of nonlinear functions include exponential functions, logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, power functions, Gaussian function, and Lorentz distributions. Some functions, such as the exponential or logarithmic functions, can be transformed so that they are linear. When so transformed, standard linear regression can be performed but must be interpreted with caution. \n",

    "In general, there is no closed-form expression for the best-fitting parameters, as there is in linear regression. Usually numerical **optimization algorithms** are applied to determine the best-fitting parameters. Again in contrast to linear regression, there may be many local minima of the function to be optimized and even the global minimum may produce a biased estimate. In practice, estimated values of the parameters are used, in conjunction with the optimization algorithm, to attempt to find the global minimum of a sum of squares or some other objective (merit, cost, value, quality) function.\n"
