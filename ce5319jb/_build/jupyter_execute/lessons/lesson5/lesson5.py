# # Supervised Learning

# ## Types of Learning
# Learning is a very wide domain. Herein the term learning refers to a computer program that senses inputs and adapts to inputs based on past behavior. Fitting a linear model to some observations would be termed learning in our context; application of that model to predict future behavior is the deployment phase.  
# 
# By virtue of different ways to perform such automated learning, the field of machine
# learning has evolved into several different types of learning tasks. The three best known are:
# 
# 1. Supervised Learning
# 2. Unsupervised Learning
# 3. Reinforcement Learning
