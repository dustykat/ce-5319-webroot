    "## Types of Learning\n",
    "Learning is a very wide domain. Herein the term learning refers to a computer program that senses inputs and adapts to inputs based on past behavior. Fitting a linear model to some observations would be termed learning in our context; application of that model to predict future behavior is the deployment phase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By virtue of different ways to perform such automated learning, the field of machine\n",
    "learning has evolved into several different types of learning tasks. The three best known are:\n",
