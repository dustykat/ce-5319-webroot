    "## Types of Learning\n",
    "Learning is a very wide domain. Herein the term learning refers to a computer program that senses inputs and adapts to inputs based on past behavior. Fitting a linear model to some observations would be termed learning in our context; application of that model to predict future behavior is the deployment phase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By virtue of different ways to perform such automated learning, the field of machine\n",
    "learning has evolved into several different types of learning tasks. The three best known are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "3. Reinforcement Learning\n",

    "In supervised learning, the dataset is a collection of **labeled** examples ${(x_i,y_i)}_{i=1}^N$ Each element of $x_i$ is called a **feature** vector, or in my jargon a **predictor**.  The **label** $y_i$ can be a class (Tasty/Yucky ...) or a real valued response, or a more complex structure.  In my jargon we called an entire row of the set the **predictor-truth** table.\n",

    "### What is supervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is defined by its extensive use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.\n"

    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and **labeled** correct outputs (similar to the truth values in the linear prediction engine example), which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data mining—classification and regression (here these two general categories reappear!):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classification uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business. Linear regression, logistical regression, and polynomial regression are popular regression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Another explaination \n",
    "The supervised learning process starts with gathering the data. The data for supervised  learning is a collection of paired or labeled information usually called **examples** (input, output). Input could be anything, for example, email  messages, pictures, or sensor voltages. Outputs are usually real numbers, or labels  (e.g. “spam”, “not_spam”, “cat”, “dog”, “mouse”, etc). In some cases, outputs are vectors (e.g.,  four coordinates of the rectangle around a person on the picture), sequences (e.g. [“adjective”,  “adjective”, “noun”] for the input “big beautiful car”), or have some other structure.  Let’s say the problem that you want to solve using supervised learning is spam detection.  You gather the data, for example, 10,000 email messages, each with a label either “spam” or  “not_spam” (you could add those labels manually or pay someone to do that for you). Now, you have to convert each email message into a feature vector.  The data analyst decides, based on their experience, how to convert a real-world entity, such  as an email message, into a feature vector. One common way to convert a text into a feature vector, called bag of words, is to take a dictionary of English words (let’s say it contains  20,000 alphabetically sorted words) and stipulate that in our feature vector:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- the first feature is equal to 1 if the email message contains the word “a”; otherwise, this  feature is 0; \n",
    "- the second feature is equal to 1 if the email message contains the word “aaron”;  otherwise, this feature equals 0;  \n",
    "- ...  \n",
    "- the feature at position 20,000 is equal to 1 if the email message contains the word  “zulu”; otherwise, this feature is equal to 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You repeat the above procedure for every email message in our collection, which gives  us 10,000 feature vectors (each vector having the dimensionality of 20,000) and a label  (“spam”/“not_spam”).  Now you have machine-readable input data, but the output labels are still in the form of  human-readable text. Some learning algorithms require transforming labels into numbers.  For example, some algorithms require numbers like 0 (to represent the label “not_spam”)  and 1 (to represent the label “spam”). A [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine) algorithm typically requires that the positive label (in  our case it’s “spam”) has the numeric value of +1 (one), and the negative label (“not_spam”) has the value of −1 (minus one). \n",
    "\n",
    "> The ladybug, catapillar example is a SVM. If you recall we generated two support vectors, which I averaged because I didn't want to write the necessary code to keep track of the two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you have a dataset and a learning algorithm, so you are ready to apply the learning algorithm to the dataset to get the model.  SVM sees every feature vector as a point in a high-dimensional space (in our case, space  is 20,000-dimensional). The algorithm puts all feature vectors on an imaginary 20,000-dimensional plot and draws an imaginary 19,999-dimensional line (a hyperplane) that separates examples with positive labels from examples with negative labels. In machine learning, the boundary separating the examples of different classes is called the **decision boundary**.  The equation of the hyperplane is given by two parameters, a real-valued vector $w$ of the  same dimensionality as our input feature vector $x$, and a real number $b$ like this:  $wx − b = 0$,  where the expression $wx$ means $w^{(1)}x^{(1)} + w^{(2)}x^{(2)} +... + w^{(D)}x^{(D)}$, and $D$ is the number  of dimensions of the feature vector $x$.   Now, the predicted label for some input feature vector $x$ is given like this:  $y = sign(wx − b)$,  where sign is a mathematical operator that takes any value as input and returns +1 if the input is a positive number or −1 if the input is a negative number. (we already used `numpy.sign()` in the bisection example)\n",

    "#### Common supervised learning algorithms\n",
    "Various algorithms and computation techniques are used in supervised machine learning processes. Below are brief explanations of some of the most commonly used learning methods, typically calculated through use of programs like R or Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neural networks (C)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Primarily leveraged for deep learning algorithms, neural networks process training data by mimicking the interconnectivity of the human brain through layers of nodes. Each node is made up of inputs, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output. If that output value exceeds a given threshold, it “fires” or activates the node, passing data to the next layer in the network. Neural networks learn this mapping function through supervised learning, adjusting based on the loss function through the process of gradient descent. When the cost function is at or near zero, we can be confident in the model’s accuracy to yield the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive Bayes (C)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is classification approach that adopts the principle of class conditional independence from the Bayes Theorem. This means that the presence of one feature does not impact the presence of another in the probability of a given outcome, and each predictor has an equal effect on that result. There are three types of Naïve Bayes classifiers: Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes. This technique is primarily used in text classification, spam identification, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear regression (P)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is used to identify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables and is typically leveraged to make predictions about future outcomes. When there is only one independent variable and one dependent variable, it is known as simple linear regression. As the number of independent variables increases, it is referred to as multiple linear regression. For each type of linear regression, it seeks to plot a line of best fit, which is calculated through the method of least squares. However, unlike other regression models, this line is straight when plotted on a graph.\n",
    "Logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "While linear regression is leveraged when dependent variables are continuous, logistical regression is selected when the dependent variable is categorical, meaning they have binary outputs, such as \"true\" and \"false\" or \"yes\" and \"no.\" While both regression models seek to understand relationships between data inputs, logistic regression is mainly used to solve binary classification problems, such as spam identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-linear regression (P)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Linear regression is used to identify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables and is typically leveraged to make predictions about future outcomes, but unlike linear regression models, there is a relaxation on the implicit or explicit requirement that the relationships are described by affine functions (straight lines, planes, hyperplanes and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support vector machines (C)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A support vector machine is a popular supervised learning model developed by Vladimir Vapnik, used for both data classification and regression. That said, it is typically leveraged for classification problems, constructing a hyperplane where the distance between two classes of data points is at its maximum. This hyperplane is known as the decision boundary, separating the classes of data points (e.g., oranges vs. apples) on either side of the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-nearest neighbor (C)**\n",
    "\n",
    "K-nearest neighbor, also known as the KNN algorithm, is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity and association to other available data. This algorithm assumes that similar data points can be found near each other. As a result, it seeks to calculate the distance between data points, usually through Euclidean distance, and then it assigns a category based on the most frequent category or average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its ease of use and low calculation time make it a preferred algorithm by data scientists, but as the test dataset grows, the processing time lengthens, making it less appealing for classification tasks. KNN is typically used for recommendation engines and image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random forest (C/P)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is another flexible supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression purposes. The \"forest\" references a collection of uncorrelated decision trees, which are then merged together to reduce variance and create more accurate data predictions.\n"

    "Unsupervised machine learning uses unlabeled data. From that data, it discovers patterns that help solve for clustering or association problems. This is particularly useful when subject matter experts are unsure of common properties within a data set. Common clustering algorithms are hierarchical, k-means, and Gaussian mixture models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised is appealing because avoids domain expertise to label data appropriately for supervised learning (we will examine unsupervised in a bit).\n",

    "\n",
    "Supervised learning models can be used to build and advance a number of business applications, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image- and object-recognition: Supervised learning algorithms can be used to locate, isolate, and categorize objects out of videos or images, making them useful when applied to various computer vision techniques and imagery analysis.\n",
    "- Predictive analytics: A widespread use case for supervised learning models is in creating predictive analytics systems to provide deep insights into various business data points. This allows enterprises to anticipate certain results based on a given output variable, helping business leaders justify decisions or pivot for the benefit of the organization.\n",
    "- Customer sentiment analysis: Using supervised machine learning algorithms, organizations can extract and classify important pieces of information from large volumes of data—including context, emotion, and intent—with very little human intervention. This can be incredibly useful when gaining a better understanding of customer interactions and can be used to improve brand engagement efforts.\n",
    "- Spam detection: Spam detection is another example of a supervised learning model. Using supervised classification algorithms, organizations can train databases to recognize patterns or anomalies in new data to organize spam and non-spam-related correspondences effectively.\n",
