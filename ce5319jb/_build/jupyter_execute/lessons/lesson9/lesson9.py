# ## Some Common Distributions 
# 
# ### Normal (and Log-Normal) Distribution
# 
# The normal distributions are used to explain central tendencies
# - Defined using two parameters
#   - Mean ($\mu$) and Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)
#   - Symmetric distribution
#   - Represents additive processes
# - The lognormal distribution stipulates that the log of random variable x (i.e., log(x) is normally distributed
#   - Does not work for negative data (in orginal space)
#   - Represents multiplicative process
#   
# Lognormal distribution is often appropriate when the data are skewed. (See the Gamma distribution later on)
# Normal and Lognormal Distributions are best suited to represent central tendencies
#   
# #### Python Examples

# ### Gamma Distribution
# 
# #### Python Examples

# ### Poisson Distribution
# 
# - A discrete distribution used to represent the number of independent events within a fixed time
#   - Number of independent rainfall events within a year
# - Related to Exponential Distribution
# - Continuous distribution for inter-arrival times
# - Poisson distribution assumes stationarity
# - Rate at which events occur is constant
# 
# An example of application is [Synthetic Rainfall Generation Model for Evaluating Potential Erosion
# at Highway Construction Sites](http://54.243.252.9/about-me-webroot/about-me/MyWebPapers/thesis/srg_model/srg_model.pdf)
# 
# #### Python Examples

# ### Exponential Distribution
# 
# - Often used to model the time between two independent
# events
#   - Time between two rainstorms
# - Exponential distribution is represented by the parameter ($\lambda$)
#   - Reciprocal of Average inter-event time
# - Related to Poisson Distribution
# - A discrete distribution for number of events in a fixed time
# 
# #### Python Examples

# ### Binomial Distribution
# 
# Used when there are two outcomes
# - Success and Failure
# - The probability of success for each event is denoted by “p”
#   - Often assumed stationary
# - The PMF calculates the probability of success of x out of N total events
# 
# The binomial distribution is often used for risk and reliability calculations
# 
# #### Python Examples

# ### Logistic Distribution
# 
# #### Python Examples

# ### Multinomial Distribution(s)
