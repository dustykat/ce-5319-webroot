    "# Common Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Two \"kinds\" of data that exist are: \n",
    "1. Quantitative \n",
    "2. Qualitative\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantitative Data\n",
    "Quantitative data deals with numbers and refers to variables that can be mea-\n",
    "sured objectively.  The root of the word is \"quantity\" which is an expression of how much of something exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The load on a building, the width of a channel, the temperature of lake, and the bearing capacity of a soil are quantitative data. While the meaning of the quantitative data is clear and unambigious there is uncertainty associated with them from measurement errors, transcription errors, and related causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qualitative Data\n",
    "Qualitative data refers descriptors that are subjective in nature. \n",
    "The root of the work is \"quality\" which is an expression of how desirable is the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors such as *small* loads, *wide* channel, *sharp* turn and *extreme* drought\n",
    "are some examples of qualitative data. The subjectivity arises because what is a\n",
    "*small* load for a large structure can be a substantial load for a small structure.\n",
    "The meaning of the qualitative data largely depends upon the situation and its\n",
    "interpretation can vary widely from one person to the next. Qualitative variables\n",
    "sometimes can be made quantitative for analysis. For example, flood is a\n",
    "qualitative variable. However, we can define a threshold flowrate to determine\n",
    "the flooding and non-flooding states in a river section."

    "# Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Four common measurement scales of data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. nominal,\n",
    "2. ordinal,\n",
    "3. interval, and \n",
    "4. ratio scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nominal Scale\n",
    "The nominal scale is the simplest of all data scales. \n",
    "These data are qualitative and often used to label the data. \n",
    "For example, a traffic survey could ask a respondent’s gender (i.e., whether they are ’Male’ or ’Female’). \n",
    "The category ’Gender’ has two labels (Male and Female) which can be be used to filter data\n",
    "for further analysis.\n",
    "Nominal scale data have no order or hierarchy associated with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordinal Scale\n",
    "The ordinal scale involves arranging data in an order. This ordering can be used\n",
    "to rank or compare two or more values. Ordinal scale also refers to qualitative\n",
    "data. For example we could classify droughts as ’mild’, moderate’ and ’severe’.\n",
    "Clearly severe droughts have far greater impacts than moderate droughts which\n",
    "in turn have a greater impact than mild droughts.\n",
    "We can also assign numeric values (say, 1 for mild, 2 for moderate and 3 for se-\n",
    "vere) to rank drought events in a region. However, we cannot do any arithmetic\n",
    "on these data (mild + moderate 6 = severe). Similarly the difference between a\n",
    "mild and moderate drought is not the same as the difference between a moderate\n",
    "and severe drought.\n",
    "Ordinal scales are often used to assess relative perceptions, choices and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interval Scale\n",
    "Interval scale data have an order and it is possible to calculate exact differences\n",
    "between the values. The interval scale is used with quantitative data. You can\n",
    "calculate summary measures (e.g., mean, variance) on interval scale data.\n",
    "The temperature measured in Celsius is a classic example of interval scale data.\n",
    "20 oC is twice the value of 10 oC (i.e., the difference is 10 oC). Similarly, the\n",
    "difference between 90 oC and 80 oC is also 10 oC. This is because the values\n",
    "are being measured on the same interval.\n",
    "However, 20 oC is not twice as hot as 10 oC. This is evident when these\n",
    "temperatures are converted to the Fahrenheit scale (10 oC = 50 oF and 20 oC\n",
    "= 68 oF ). The reason for this is that there is no absolute zero in either Celsius\n",
    "of Fahrenheit scales. Zero just another measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ratio Scale\n",
    "Variables measured on the ratio scale have an order, there are measured on\n",
    "fixed intervals (differences between two values can be calculated) and have an\n",
    "absolute zero. In other words, Ratio Scale has all the properties of an interval\n",
    "scale and also has an absolute zero. Ratio scale is used for quantitative data.\n",
    "Consider daily rainfall amounts. There is an absolute zero which corresponds to\n",
    "no rainfall. Other measurable amounts of rainfall are measured with respect to\n",
    "this absolute zero. 20’ of rainfall is more than 10’ of rainfall. Also, 20’ of rainfall\n",
    "is twice the amount of 10’ accumulation. Their ratio is equal to 2. In a similar\n",
    "vein, 3’ of rainfall is twice the amount of 6’ accumulation (again the ratio is\n",
    "2). As the name suggests, variables measured on ratio scale can be divided to\n",
    "obtain ratios or the degree of proportionality between two observations.\n",
    "3\n"

    "# Continuous and Discrete Data\n",
    "Quantitative data can be further split into continuous and discrete data.\n",
    "Discrete data are integers and refer to variables that measure whole or indivisible entities. \n",
    "The number of vehicles passing an intersection over a year is discrete data as this is a whole number (integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous data on the other hand are not restricted to integer values but also can take on fractional or decimal values. For example, The temperature of water in a lake can be 67.3$^o$F .\n",
    "Sometimes a variable that is continuous can be discretely measured or made\n",
    "discrete. For example, if we measure (or round off) the temperature of a lake\n",
    "to the nearest degree then we would have temperature measurements that are\n",
    "only integers. While continuous variables can be treated as discrete due to\n",
    "measurement limitations or data approximations, it is important to remember\n",
    "that intrinsically they can take continuous values and the discretization was\n",
    "simply a matter of convenience or a measurement limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary measures of discrete variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation) can\n",
    "sometime have decimal values. For example, if 3 cars pass an intersection in\n",
    "the first hour and 4 cars in the second then the average number of cars is 3.5.\n",
    "In such instances, the value must be rounded appropriately (say to 4 if we are\n",
    "using it to estimate design loads on the pavement) as the decimal number is not\n",
    "physically realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous on a real line\n",
    "Some variables in civil engineering are continuous on a real line (axis). For\n",
    "example, soil temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit can assume both\n",
    "positive and negative values in cold regions.\n",
    "Similarly, the groundwater table measured with respect to mean sea level (MSL)\n",
    "can be either positive (i.e., below MSL) or negative (above MSL). A zero value\n",
    "simply suggests that the water table coincides with MSL which is just as a valid\n",
    "state as water table being above or below MSL.\n",
    "For variables that are continuous on a real line (axis), zero values have no special\n",
    "meaning and represent yet another value that the variable can take. In other\n",
    "words, they are often measured on an interval scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Positive Continuous Variables\n",
    "As discussed above, the magnitude of a force is always positive. As this magni-\n",
    "tude can take decimal values it is a positive continuous variable. Many variables\n",
    "of interest to civil engineers are positive continuous. Flowrates, pollutant con-\n",
    "centrations, the magnitude of shear stresses are all positive continuous.\n",
    "Some variables that are continuous on a real line can also be made positive con-\n",
    "tinuous by shifting the datum. For example, there are no negative temperatures\n",
    "on Kelvin scale. Temperatures measured using Celsius scale can be made all\n",
    "positive by converting them into Kelvin scale. In a similar vein, the groundwa-\n",
    "ter table measurements at a well can be made all positive by measuring values\n",
    "from the top of the well casing (assuming positive downwards) instead of the\n",
    "mean sea level.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mixture Datasets\n",
    "The positive continuous scale starts at zero and in theory extends all the way to\n",
    "infinity. For some positive continuous variables zero is yet another value if they\n",
    "are measured on the interval scale. On the other hand if they are measured on\n",
    "a ratio scale the value of zero is absolute and can assume special importance.\n",
    "For example, zero rainfall implies no rainfall. Therefore, a time-series data of\n",
    "daily rainfall in a year can have several values of zero (no rainfall) and some days\n",
    "with positive (non-zero rainfall). Such a dataset can be viewed as a mixture\n",
    "- At a high level the data is discrete where each day belongs to either (rain-\n",
    "fall=Yes) or (rainfall=No) state. Non-zero, positive continuous values exist for\n",
    "(Rainfall=Yes) state (see Figure 1).\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar mixtures can also be seen with strictly discrete data. For example, if one were\n",
    "to count number of vehicles passing an intersection every hour of a day, there\n",
    "could be hours with no vehicles passing the intersection (traffic = No) and hours\n",
    "where some vehicles passed the intersection (traffic = Yes). A discrete dataset\n",
    "with non-zero values would correspond to the (traffic = Yes) state.\n",
    "It is therefore important to ascertain upfront whether the value of zero is a\n",
    "valid measurement for the questions we seek to address and how zero values will be handled during the analysis. Inclusion of a large number of zeros (zero-\n",
    "inflated datasets) will lower the mean and will affect other summary measures,\n",
    "on the other hand, exclusion of zero when it is a valid system response will lead\n",
    "to selection bias. The choices on how to handle zeros will depend upon the\n",
    "questions one seek to answer. It is important that the decision is made explicit\n",
    "and justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Truncated Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncated data arise when values beyond a certain boundary are either not\n",
    "collected or removed prior to analysis. For example, the exclusion of zero values\n",
    "from a mixture data is one form of truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) devices measure axle weights and gross vehicle weights of trucks while in motion. WIM data are used to estimate potential loads on bridges and also to select vehicles for static inspection (yep, profiling!). Trucks weighing below a certain weight are allowed to pass through or even when their weights are collected, the data is discarded when ascertaining design loads. There is a threshold load boundary that is used to truncate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flooding risks are often estimated using peak annual maximum flow data.\n",
    "While flowrates are measured at a much higher rate (every 1 - 15 minutes), much of these data are discarded when assessing flooding risks. There is a threshold boundary that separates the maximum observed flow (`state == max.flow`) from the rest of the dataset (`state != max. flow`). However, the boundary in this case is not stable and varies annually. For example, The maximum flow obtained in a dry year could be lower than say the tenth highest flow observed in a wet year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncation of data is also common when conducting or analyzing surveys .\n",
    "Certain surveys may target a specific age-group (teenage drivers) while exclud-\n",
    "ing others. Survey’s focused on environmental justice issues tend to focus on\n",
    "low-income neighborhoods in industrial areas. These data subsets are often\n",
    "extracted from larger ”quality of life” surveys that include respondents from\n",
    "different socioeconomic strata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncation of data creates a selection bias; hence any truncation/censoring made explicitly during data analysis or implicitly during data collection must be well documented. Inferences drawn from the censored data will be biased towards the sub-population that was sampled and will not be representative of the entire population. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a lot of applications truncating is appropriate, necessary, and understood - in instances where this is not so, disclosure is vital."
