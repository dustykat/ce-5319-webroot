    "## Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks, inspired by biological neural systems, are computational models designed to recognize patterns and relationships in data. They consist of interconnected artificial neurons that process information in a layered structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In civil engineering, neural networks can be applied to problems such as hydrological modeling, structural health monitoring, and material classification. This chapter provides an overview of neural network classification, with examples and applications relevant to engineering problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks can be broadly categorized into three main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** â€“ Traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models used for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** â€“ Specialized for image and spatial data processing.\n",
    "3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** â€“ Designed for sequential data and time series predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedforward Neural Networks (ANN)\n",
    "A **feedforward neural network (FNN)** is the simplest form of ANN, where data flows in one directionâ€”from input to outputâ€”without cycles. The **multi-layer perceptron (MLP)**, a common type of FNN, consists of multiple layers: an **input layer**, one or more **hidden layers**, and an **output layer**. Each neuron in a layer is connected to neurons in the next layer via weighted connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training involves adjusting these weights using **backpropagation**, a method that minimizes error by propagating corrections backward through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Reference:** Upadhyay, Y. (2019). *Deep Learning Models for Civil Engineering Applications*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n",
    "**CNNs** are widely used in image processing tasks, including structural damage detection and remote sensing. They consist of **convolutional layers** that apply filters to detect features, followed by **pooling layers** that downsample the data to reduce dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs share weights across neurons, making them highly efficient for spatial data analysis. Their architecture includes:\n",
    "- **Convolutional layers** â€“ Extract feature representations.\n",
    "- **Pooling layers** â€“ Reduce complexity and improve generalization.\n",
    "- **Fully connected layers** â€“ Interpret extracted features for classification or regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Applications:** \n",
    "> - Crack detection in concrete structures (Sharma, P., 2021).\n",
    "> - Satellite image-based flood prediction (Tang, Y. et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n",
    "RNNs are designed for sequential data and are commonly used for hydrological modeling, rainfall-runoff forecasting, and time-series analysis. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)** are advanced RNN architectures that can capture dependencies over long time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example Application:** Runoff forecasting using a hybrid **CNN-GBDT** model, which integrates convolutional layers with decision trees to improve prediction accuracy (Tang et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Network Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Neurons and Activation Functions\n",
    "Each neuron receives weighted inputs and applies an **activation function** to introduce non-linearity. Common activation functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sigmoid**: Outputs values between (0,1), useful for probability-based models but suffers from **vanishing gradients**.\n",
    "- **Tanh**: Outputs values in (-1,1), mitigating some vanishing gradient issues.\n",
    "- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Outputs zero for negative values and identity for positive values, improving training efficiency.\n",
    "- **Leaky ReLU**: A variant of ReLU that allows small gradients for negative values, preventing \"dead neurons.\"\n",
    "- **Softmax**: Used in classification tasks, converting logits into probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Reference:** Baheti, (2022). *Neural Network Activation Functions: A Comparative Study*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Weights, Biases, and Learning\n",
    "Neural networks adjust **weights and biases** during training using **gradient descent**. The most common optimization technique is **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**, often improved with momentum-based methods such as **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Loss Functions\n",
    "Loss functions evaluate how well a network performs. Common choices include:\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** â€“ For regression tasks.\n",
    "- **Cross-Entropy Loss** â€“ For classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Forward Propagation\n",
    "In **forward propagation**, inputs pass through the network layers, applying weight transformations and activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Backpropagation\n",
    "Using **gradient descent**, the **error** between predicted and actual outputs is propagated backward to update weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hyperparameters\n",
    "Neural networks require tuning of hyperparameters such as:\n",
    "- **Learning rate** â€“ Controls the step size in gradient descent.\n",
    "- **Batch size** â€“ Number of training examples per update.\n",
    "- **Number of hidden layers** â€“ Determines model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
