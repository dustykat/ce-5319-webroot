    "Consider fingerprinting of origin of a nuclear event (suppose something goes boom, and you areÂ tasked with placing blame).  A fusion device would discharge some unreacted plutonium 238, fingerprinting to either the USA, Russia, UK, France or China.  It is not believed India or North Korea have viable fusion devices. Plutionium mixed with other fallout materials is hard to detect, but even minute amounts emit alpha particles (which can be traced!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha detectors record the intensity of alpha particle strikes in counts per second.  A prediction engine (regression model) is used to estimate the alpha counts (target variable) from plutonium activity (feature variable).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the calibration set contained at [PLUTONIUM.DAT](http://54.243.252.9/ce-5319-webroot/2-Exercises/ES-3/PLUTONIUM.DAT).  The first column is alpha strikes per second, the second is plutonium activity. These data are from four different plutonium standards containing known plutonium activity. The levels are 0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 picocuries per gram.  Each standard was exposed to the detetection device from 4 to 10 times and the rate of alpha strikes was observed for each replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these data build a prediction engine that takes as input alpha strikes per second and predicts plutonium activity (an inverse regression) for a particular detector instrument.  \n",
    "\n",

    "- Do any of the data appear to be outliers?  \n",
    "- Likely your original prototype engine will be $Y_{\\alpha} \\propto X_{Pu}$\n",
    "- Is the variance constant at different plutonium activities?\n",
